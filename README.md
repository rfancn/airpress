## 🔀 About this fork

AirPress is a fork of the [go-sonic/sonic](https://github.com/go-sonic/sonic) project, renamed and maintained at [rfancn/airpress](https://github.com/rfancn/airpress).

Upstream has not received new commits since May 2024, so AirPress is now the actively maintained continuation of the project:

- **New features** keep being developed here.
- **Issues are triaged and fixed here** — please report bugs and request features in [rfancn/airpress/issues](https://github.com/rfancn/airpress/issues) instead of the upstream repository.
- Existing data, configuration files and themes remain compatible with the upstream project.

Thanks to the [Halo](https://github.com/halo-dev) project team, who inspired this project. The front-end is a project fork from Halo.
